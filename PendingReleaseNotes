14.2.9
------

* Bucket notifications now support Kafka endpoints. This requires librdkafka of
  version 0.9.2 and up. Note that Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus) has an older
  version of librdkafka, and would require an update to the library.

* The pool parameter ``target_size_ratio``, used by the pg autoscaler,
  has changed meaning. It is now normalized across pools, rather than
  specifying an absolute ratio. For details, see :ref:`pg-autoscaler`.
  If you have set target size ratios on any pools, you may want to set
  these pools to autoscale ``warn`` mode to avoid data movement during
  the upgrade::

    ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_autoscale_mode warn

* The behaviour of the ``-o`` argument to the rados tool has been reverted to
  its orignal behaviour of indicating an output file. This reverts it to a more
  consistent behaviour when compared to other tools. Specifying object size is now
  accomplished by using an upper case O ``-O``.

* The format of MDSs in `ceph fs dump` has changed.

* Ceph will issue a health warning if a RADOS pool's ``size`` is set to 1
  or in other words the pool is configured with no redundancy. This can
  be fixed by setting the pool size to the minimum recommended value
  with::

    ceph osd pool set <pool-name> size <num-replicas>

  The warning can be silenced with::

    ceph config set global mon_warn_on_pool_no_redundancy false

* RGW: bucket listing performance on sharded bucket indexes has been
  notably improved by heuristically -- and significantly, in many
  cases -- reducing the number of entries requested from each bucket
  index shard.
